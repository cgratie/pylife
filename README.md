# pylife

This is a lightweight implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python.


## How to use

The game is text-based and runs in the terminal. It makes use of ANSI sequences for colors.

* clone this repository
* `cd pylife`
* `clear && ./play.py cfg/original_colors.py` for the version with colors, or
* `clear && ./play.py cfg/original_plain.py` for the plain version (no ANSI sequences, just plain text)

That's it!


## How to try new things

You can edit the configuration files to change the board size, the colors, or even the rules of the game. Most of that is traightforward, but I'll post more detailed instructions soon.
